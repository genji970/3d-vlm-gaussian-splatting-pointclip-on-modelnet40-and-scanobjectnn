### achieved more than 96 accuracy on modelnet40 test dataset with lightweighted custome model pipeline. ###

### Projecting (added gaussian splatting) 3d pointcloud dataset into 2d image and putting them to clip vit-b/16  ###

### This image is about sampling test ###

# How to use

1) `git clone this repo`
2) `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3) `if it's first time running this model, then in inference.py, set exist_flag = True`


# additional

1) `I will make config.py to set hyperparameters easily later`
2) `torch in requirements.txt is cpu only. change it if you want to use cuda`
3) `sample test accuracy is 70% but overall performance is 95 for this pth`
